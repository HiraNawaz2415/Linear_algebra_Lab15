# ðŸ”¢ Linear Algebra Toolkit â€“ Streamlit App

A user-friendly interactive web app built with **Streamlit** for performing key **linear algebra** operations such as matrix addition, multiplication, transpose, determinant, inverse, eigenvalues/eigenvectors, LU decomposition, and diagonalization. It also provides **heatmap visualizations** to help interpret matrix data easily.

## Features

- Input custom matrices with dynamic row/column settings
- Perform common matrix operations:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Transpose
  - Determinant
  - Inverse
- Advanced operations:
  - **LU Decomposition**
  - **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**
  - **Matrix Diagonalization**
- Visualize matrices and results using **Seaborn heatmaps**
- Organized output with **expanders** for a clean layout

## ðŸ–¥ Demo

> Coming Soon: [Live App Deployment on Streamlit Share or Hugging Face Spaces]
